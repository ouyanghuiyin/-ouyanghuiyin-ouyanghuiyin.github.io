 Business decision-making involves considerable complexity and uncertainty. This course introduces the basic concepts in quantitative business analysis to help students gain a clear understanding of the key elements in the decision-making process. This course covers the tools and the skills to analyze and solve problems by stressing approaches to 1) understand and question assumptions, 2) consider a richer set of solution alternatives, and 3) consider diverse measures of performance. The teaching methods will include lectures, skill-building exercises, qualitative class discussions, and a project with the support of several software packages in Microsoft Excel.
