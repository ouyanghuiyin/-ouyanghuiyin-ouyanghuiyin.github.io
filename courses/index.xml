An organization&amp;rsquo;s ultimate success depends on how efficiently and effectively it executes its strategic goals. This requires its operational goals to be aligned with its strategic goals. A detailed understanding of the processes used to produce and deliver goods and/or provide services to customers is essential. Operations Management is a field which focuses on these aspects of an organization.
Operations of an organization concerns the management of the processes which convert inputs into outputs. Effective operations management involves managing people, equipment, and other resources. In the typical business organization the majority of the costs and controllable assets are managed by the operations function. Thus, this discipline–with the techniques, procedures and knowledge it encompasses–is a vital segment of business activity.
This course will provide students with the analytical tools needed to understand and articulate the impact of an organization&amp;rsquo;s processes and the ability to continuously improve these processes.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>MSBA7014 Business Simulation</title><link>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/courses/graduate/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/courses/graduate/</guid><description>&lt;p>This course introduces simulation modeling to analyze business processes and solve practical problems. Students will gain basic knowledge such as Monte Carlo simulation and discrete event simulation and learn to build simulation models of business processes and interpret simulation results, and more importantly, facilitate decision-making process. This is a hands-on course on computer simulation with @Risk (&lt;a href="http://www.palisade.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.palisade.com&lt;/a>) and Simio (&lt;a href="http://www.simio.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.simio.com&lt;/a>).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>IIMT3636 Decision and Risk Analysis</title><link>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/courses/undergraduate/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Sep 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/courses/undergraduate/</guid><description>&lt;p>Business decision-making involves considerable complexity and uncertainty. This course introduces the basic concepts in quantitative business analysis to help students gain a clear understanding of the key elements in the decision-making process. This course covers the tools and the skills to analyze and solve problems by stressing approaches to understand and question assumptions, consider a richer set of solution alternatives, and consider diverse measures of performance.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
