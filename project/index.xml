With many countries struggling with healthcare systems being overloaded by patients and reaching breaking points, it not only highlighted the importance of efficient and prompt response but also the need for strategic and long-term planning of healthcare systems and system-wide preparation to face such extreme cases. With local and national situations changing rapidly due to the unprecedented rate of spread, many hospitals are forced to make daily decisions on how to allocate their limited capacity (e.g., beds, ventilators, and medical staff) and manage patient flow within and across hospitals. We aim to develop a systematic data-driven response strategy to Novel Infectious Disease (NID) outbreaks: REsource allocation and CApacity Planning (RECAP). The strategy has both short term and long term benefits for heathcare institution administrators and policy makers in the fight against NIDs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PI: Optimal bed allocation in intensive care unit with patients health evolution and patient readmission 2021-2023</title><link>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/project/ecs/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/project/ecs/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Co-I: Impact of emergency department waiting time announcements on patient behavior 2020 - 2022</title><link>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/project/grfed/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ouyanghuiyin.github.io/project/grfed/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
